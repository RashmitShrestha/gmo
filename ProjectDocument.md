For each team member, you shoudl work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item git. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replace any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

# Main Roles #

- Producer (Rashmit)
- Animation and Visuals (Jordan)

## Producer (Rashmit, Rashura on Github)

I am the producer for the group, organizing tasks, managing meetup schedules, and overseeing the entire process!

### Github Manager - I managed our repo and dealt with merge conflicts.

I initiated the GitHub repo and started the process. In addition, I constantly oversaw the active pull requests, status of branches, and helped fixed any merge conflicts. This effort required everyone's participation and help, through making sure what will be added and what sort of merge conflicts it may cause is clearly communicated to the entire group via Discord. In addition, there were many merge conflicts as the scene files are largely autogenerated, but through careful coordination, planning, and execution, everyone was able to merge their changes seamlessly for an overall polished product!

### Discord Server - I organized our main source of communication: our Discord server.

In order to ensure clear communications, the sharing of resources, and a sense of community, I started the GMO! Discord Server. This server features many chats and channels for different purposes such as tool systems, assets, game story, etc. In addition, this features the to-do list channel where the team writes down what to focus on every week, and crosses them out as objectives change and tasks become complete.

![Github Commits](<ProjectDocument Images/discord_todo.png>)

### External Communication - I communicated with other groups and the Professor

Even outside of the team, communication is extremely important: I spoke with other groups about their game and shared insights from ours, which included starting email lines between different groups during our progress report. In addition, I made sure to attend class and stayed in order to talk to the professor and TAs if need be, while making sure the feedback from the group is shared. 

### Filling In - I was there when something lacked. 

A large part of taking the lead is to be able to support everyone in their team, no matter their need. So I helped with a multitude of tasks during my time as the producer, which included helping design GUIs, implementing the skill tree, coding the combat and elemental system, and helping out with any other requests and tasks set by my team. I believe most of my time and effort was spent on this, as my focus on the and individual needs helped create a final piece that we can all be proud of!

![Filling In](<ProjectDocument Images/discord_filling_in.png>)

### Assets - I drew and animated all assets except TileMap and UI elements.

![Jordan's Assets](<ProjectDocument Images/jordan-assets.jpeg>)

This includes:
- MC Warden Gramsey (running in all directions, idle, hurt, death)
- Fruits (attack, hurt, idle, death):
  - Blueberry
  - Strawberry
  - Watermelon
  - Grape
  - Pomegranate
  - Grapes and Single Grapes
  - Cornucopia Final Boss
- Peach Tree with animation
- Main menu background
- Skill Tree background and peaches
- GMO! Logo
- the two types of seed bullets

### Visual Style
![GMO Logi](<gmo/assets/Main Menu/gmo_logo.png>)
We wanted a vibrant, cute, and fun 2D pixel style game that emphasizes visual charm while still making it intense. Warden is a chef who accidentally made sentient fruit, so I wanted his design to reflect this crazy chef who would probably blow up a kitchen given the chance (crazy eyes and dramatic coat). The fruits are all designed to look fierce while maintaining likeability, like Mario's enemies. I tried to emphasize this in their movements, facial expressions, and how they are posed in the logo.
We chose for the peach tree to be animated, to draw attention to it and remind the player that it is a crucial structure to defend.

### Animation
All animated assets were animated and previewed in my drawing program. When assetes were approved, I exported them as sprite sheets and uploaded them into Godot.
I set up animation players for all animated assets. All were created by setting the sprite sheed for that animation, adjusting h and v frames, and setting frames according to custom playback speed.
Afterwards, I set up an animation tree and drew the animation state machine. I set conditions and applicable transition constraints for each transition.

All assets have an [AnimationManagerComponent](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/4e3038445af44eb82a12f019032c73c315dc8e17/gmo/scripts/components/character_components/player_components/player_animation_manager_component.gd#L1C1-L19C78). It separates gameplay logic from animation tree system. For every character:
- Idle animation alawys plays by default
- If parent is damaged, plays hurt animation once (per damage). Since it takes a second to play the whole animation, I set it so the animation has to finish playing before playing again, otherwise it wouldn't show because the enemy is taking damage in rapid succession. 
- If enemy is attacking, plays attack animation once (per attack).

This AnimationManagerComponent makes it easy to just insert boolean updates in the main enemy scripts, and the animation will take care of itself.

Warden has a special [BlendSpace2D](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/commit/9097a6e30d26481a5a1949c2a3c7678e9880c04e#diff-9632bb3e417d0906704663b39dbbedd9c3fd22e935f9eac465456d5ed93eaad8R1), which helps automatically determine the correct running animation to play depending on which way the character is facing.

[Death animations](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/4e3038445af44eb82a12f019032c73c315dc8e17/gmo/scripts/characters/fruit.gd#L122C1-L131C20) are played manually from the AnimationPlayer. I also had to make sure the animation fully plays before the actual death function begins, to ensure the player can visually see the animation play before the game officially considers the enemy death and turns off visibility.

# Sub-Roles 

- Audio (Rashmit)
- Game Feel (Jordan)
- Others, add roles here!

## Audio
I created the audio system and created all the music.

For the music, I used FL Studios, a digital audio workstation, and I created all the beats using sounds that are part of free kits and the default instruments and effects that the software comes with. 

All of the musical pieces are [here!](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/tree/main/gmo/music)

Even before producing, I mapped out and sampled different types of video game music, involving a plethora of instruments from 8bit sounds to full orchestral pieces. I landed on using airy instruments like flutes and synths in order to inspire a care-free and whimsical vibe to the music. Generally, my songs are featured in **G major** or adjacent, in order to inspire a light-hearted melody, and I found it worked well the most with the other vibes. 

In addition, this meant implementing the Audio systems into Godot and making sure the decibels are at a correct loudness, starting auto play and making sure there weren't any conflicts with the music from other scenes. 


## Game Feel

I focused on visual screen feedback with shaders.
The [health bar shakes](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/e5c976f20b69b999fd87a8b62518a438c27f42dc/gmo/scripts/ui/health_bar.gd#L44C1-L62C3) when player takes damage, making damage more impactful and noticable. 
When player health is below 20%, a [red vignette](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/e5c976f20b69b999fd87a8b62518a438c27f42dc/gmo/scripts/ui/health_bar.gd#L65C1-L72C53) is applied on screan, notifying the player that they are low health and should take more caution. 
The actual vignette shader code is from the Godot Shader website [here](https://godotshaders.com/shader/vignette-2/). I edited its opacity and strength depending on what the health is.
It was imperative that Warden had a quick and reactive damage indicator, so the animation player/tree was not enough. Also, I had only drawn a hurt animation for when he was idle, and I quickly realized this was not ideal because he had a bunch of different animations that he could be in when he gets hit. I used self modulate to quickly tint his original color by [red](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/e5c976f20b69b999fd87a8b62518a438c27f42dc/gmo/scripts/characters/warden.gd#L186C2-L188C42) no matter what state he was in, and he would always turn red upon impact.

I also introduced visual feedback in sprites as well. I drew unlocked, ready to unlock, and unlocked peaches for the skill tree menu, so the player can instantly see which nodes they can unlock by color alone.
