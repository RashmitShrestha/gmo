Zi Zeng (zkH2O)
  Main Role: System Tools Engineer
    *Wave Management System* - Implemented a complete wave based enemy spawning system using resource design patterns. The WaveManager handles wave progression, enemy group spawning with configurable patterns such as random perimeter, cluster, line, circle, spread, and dynamic difficulty scaling through enemy modifiers. The system uses a state machine ie. IDLE, SPAWNING, ACTIVE to control wave flow and tracks all spawned enemies using instance IDs to solve race conditions in detecting wave completion. [WaveManager Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/wave_manager.gd)

    *Resource Based Data Architecture* - Created a comprehensive system using Godot's Resource classes. The classes were WaveData, EnemyStats, EnemyGroup, which allows designers to configure waves, enemies, and spawn patterns without touching code. Each resource file defines wave composition, enemy modifiers, spawn behaviors, and difficulty curves. [Wave Data Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/resources/wave_data.gd) | [Enemy Stats Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/resources/enemy_stats.gd) | [Enemy Group Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/resources/enemy_group.gd)

    *Score and Progression System* - Built a scoring system that tracks kills, wave completions, deaths, and time played. The ScoreManager uses observer pattern through SignalBus to react to game events such as enemy deaths, wave completions, player deaths and calculates bonuses based on damage avoidance and completion speed. Implemented XP system that feeds into the skill tree progression. [Score Manager Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/score_manager.gd)

    *Signal Based Communication Architecture* - Implemented the SignalBus singleton that provides decoupled communication between game systems. Added signals for wave events, enemy tracking, player/tree death, and health changes. [SignalBus Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/SignalBus.gd)

  Sub-Role: Gameplay Testing
    *Wave Progression Balancing* - Tested wave spawning behavior, enemy counts, and boss timing. Fixed critical bugs where waves wouldn't start correctly due to race conditions in enemy tracking. [Wave 5 Resource](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/resources/waves/wave_05.tres) | [Wave 10 Resource](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/resources/waves/wave_10.tres)

    *Death and Respawn Mechanics Testing* - Tested and refined the player death/respawn system and game over conditions. Identified and fixed exploit where players could hide behind bushes after the tree died because enemies continued targeting the dead tree. Implemented proper tree death detection that triggers enemy target switching. [Fruit Targeting Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/characters/fruit.gd#L40-L41)

    *Debug Tools Implementation* - Created debug keybinds N=next wave, K=clear enemies, R=reset, P=progress, 1-0=jump to specific waves to facilitate rapid testing iterations. Implemented comprehensive debug logging throughout the wave system to track enemy spawning, deaths, and wave state transitions. The most keys were later removed for the final build. [Current Debug Section](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/wave_manager.gd#L382-L426) | [Full Debug Implementation (with wave jump keys)](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/70f7922/gmo/scripts/wave_manager.gd#L356-L395)

  Other Contributions
    *Enemy AI Targeting System* - Implemented dynamic target switching for enemy AI where fruits attack the peach tree by default but intelligently switch to the warden if the tree is destroyed. Added tree death detection that prevents enemies from attacking dead structures, fixing a gameplay exploit. This required careful integration with the signal system to respond to tree death events. [Fruit AI Logic](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/characters/fruit.gd#L40-L41) | [Tree Death System](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/peach_tree.gd#L21-L38)

    *Game End Screen and Victory/Defeat UI* - Created the end game screen that displays comprehensive statistics including score breakdown, deaths, wave reached, and time played. Implemented conditional display for victory vs defeat states with appropriate color coding and messaging. Integrated with ScoreManager to pull real-time game statistics. [Game End Screen Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scenes/ui/game_end_screen.gd)

    *Wave Messaging System* - Built the wave announcement UI that displays "WAVE X STARTING!" and "WAVE X CLEARED!" messages with fade-in/fade-out animations using Godot's Tween system. Added special boss announcement for wave 10. This provides crucial player feedback about game state progression. [Wave Message Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/ui/wave_message.gd)

    *Boss Spawn System Integration* - Implemented the Cornucopia boss spawn mechanics including delayed spawning, tracking of boss-spawned child enemies (babies), and victory condition detection when boss and all spawned enemies are defeated. Added proper boss defeated flag tracking to prevent duplicate spawns and correctly trigger game completion. [Boss Spawn Logic](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/wave_manager.gd#L135-L141) | [Cornucopia Spawn Command](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/commands/character_commands/cornucopia_commands/cornucopia_spawn_command.gd)

    *Peach Tree Core Mechanics* - Developed the peach tree as a defendable objective with health tracking, death state management, and skill tree interaction functionality. Implemented proper death behavior that disables collision, makes the tree invulnerable, and broadcasts tree death signals to update enemy targeting across all active fruits. [Peach Tree Script](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/peach_tree.gd)

    *Player Respawn System* - Implemented warden respawn mechanics with configurable respawn time, invulnerability period after respawn, and conditional respawning that checks if the tree is still alive (game over if tree is dead). Added respawn position system and health restoration upon successful respawn. [Player Died Command](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/commands/character_commands/player_commands/player_died_command.gd)

    *XP and Skill Progression System* - Designed and implemented the experience point earning system that rewards players for kills, wave completions, and performance bonuses (damage avoidance, speed). XP feeds into the skill tree system, enabling player progression and upgrade unlocks. Calculated bonus XP for flawless play and efficient wave clearing to encourage skillful gameplay. This system adds long-term progression and replayability to the wave-based combat. [XP System in ScoreManager](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/score_manager.gd#L221-L283)

    *Spawn Point System* - Created a perimeter-based spawn system with 8+ spawn markers positioned on map edges to ensure enemies appear from off-screen. Integrated spawn point discovery into WaveManager to support multiple spawn patterns (spread, cluster, line formations). This prevents enemies from spawning on top of the player and creates more natural wave encounters. [Spawn Point Logic](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/wave_manager.gd#L71-L82) | [Spawn Position Calculation](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/blob/main/gmo/scripts/wave_manager.gd#L246-L294)

    *Wave Content Design and Balancing* - Designed and configured all 10 waves using the resource system, balancing enemy counts, spawn patterns, difficulty modifiers, and completion bonuses. Structured wave progression from simple starter waves (blueberries) to complex multi-group challenges with elemental modifiers. Added boss waves at wave 5 and 10 with special mechanics. Each wave is tuned for escalating difficulty while maintaining fairness. [All Wave Resources](https://github.com/RashmitShrestha/gmo/tree/main/gmo/resources/waves)

    *Enemy Stats and Configuration* - Created and balanced stats for all 8 enemy types (Blueberry, Strawberry, Banana, Grape, Pomegranate, Watermelon, Cornucopia boss, and Grape Split) using the EnemyStats resource system. Defined health values, damage outputs, movement speeds, attack patterns, and score values for each enemy type. This data-driven approach allows for easy balancing without code changes.

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).
