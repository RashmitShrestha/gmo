## Playtester 1 - Kyle C.

### In-Game Observations
pretty focused the whole time, kept trying to get closer to enemies than needed. died twice on wave 6 slammed the table. got really excited during the boss fight.

### In-Game Questions

**Why did you make that choice?**
I thought getting closer would do more damage, but I guess it just matters how fast I swipe. I wasn't totally sure at first.

**Does that rule seem confusing?**
The velocity thing took me a minute to figure out, honestly. I get it now, but at first I was just clicking randomly.

**What did you think that would do?**
When I unlocked the Freeze Frame ability, I thought it would freeze one enemy, not all of them. That was sick, though, when it actually happened.

**What is confusing for you?**
I still don't really get some of the keybinds.

### Postgame Questions

#### General Questions

**What was your first impression?**
Honestly, I thought it looked pretty simple at first, like just another fruit slashing game or whatever.

**How did that impression change as you played?**
Dude, it gets way harder than I expected. The different fruit types keep you on your toes.

**Was there anything you found frustrating?**
Hitting the fruit was hard sometimes.

**Did the game drag at any point?**
Not really.

**Were there particular aspects that you found satisfying?**
Slicing through a bunch of blueberries at once feels super good. Also, the skill menu buy noise. LMFAO

**What was the most exciting moment in the game?**
When the boss showed up I thought, Oh how pretty.

**Did the game feel too long, too short, or just about right?**
Maybe a bit long? Ten waves is a lot if you're trying to do it all in one sitting.

#### Formal Elements

**Describe the objective of the game.**
Kill all the evil fruits and protect your peach tree.

**Was the objective clear at all times?**
Yeah, pretty much.

**What types of choices did you make during the game?**
Mostly which upgrades to get and when to focus on killing versus defending the tree.

**What was the most important decision you made?**
Prob getting the freeze ability.

**What was your strategy for winning?**
I went all in on frost upgrades for the slow and freeze.

**Did you find any loopholes in the system?**
Not really a loophole, but if you stay near the tree you can protect it way easier.

**How would you describe the conflict?**
You vs. waves of increasingly difficult fruit enemies, with time pressure since they're coming for your tree.

**In what way did you interact with other players?**
Didn't play with anyone else, just me.

**Do you prefer to play alone or with human opponents?**
Alone is fine for this type of game. Maybe co-op would be cool, but I don't know how that would work.

**What elements do you think could be improved?**
A tutorial would help. Also, maybe show the damage numbers bigger so you know if you're doing it right.

#### Dramatic Elements

**Was the game's premise appealing to you?**
Yeah, the whole "chef accidentally creates evil sentient fruit" thing is pretty funny.

**Did the story enhance or detract from the game?**
I didn't really think about the story while playing, but it's a fun setup.

**As you played, did the story evolve with the game?**
Not really, it's mostly just "survive" the whole time.

**Is this game appropriate for the target audience?**
Yeah, I think so. It's not too complex but also not baby mode.

**On a piece of paper, graph your emotional involvement over the course of the game.**
Started low, stayed medium through waves 1-5, spiked hard on waves 6-10 and the boss.

**Did you feel a sense of dramatic climax as the game progressed?**
For sure, the boss fight at the end felt epic.

**How would you make the story and game work better as a whole?**
Maybe add some dialogue or cutscenes between waves, just little bits to remind you why you're fighting.

#### Procedures, rules, interface, and controls

**Were the procedures and rules easy to understand?**
Mostly, yeah. The slashing mechanic took a few tries to get the hang of.

**How did the controls feel? Did they make sense?**
Felt good once I understood it. Mouse for attacking makes sense.

**Could you find the information you needed on the interface?**
No, would be nice to see cooldowns for abilities.

**Was there anything about the interface you would change?**
Maybe make the skill tree easier to read? It's kind of cut off.

**Did anything feel clunky, awkward, or confusing?**
Sometimes I'd try to slash and nothing would happen. Not sure if that's a bug or me messing up.

**Are there any controls or interface features you would like to see added?**
Hotkeys for abilities would be clutch.

#### End of Session

**Overall, how would you describe this game's appeal?**
Fun arcadey hack and slash with some strategy. Good for quick play sessions or trying to beat your high score.

**Would you purchase this game?**
Nah.

**What elements of the game have reached you?**
The combat feels really satisfying when you get into a rhythm.

**What was missing from the game?**
More enemy variety, maybe?

**If you could change just one thing, what would it be?**
Add a checkpoint system or shorter game mode. Ten waves is a commitment.

**Who do you think is the target audience for this game?**
Casual gamers who like arcade games and roguelikes.

**If you were to give this game as a gift, who would you give it to?**
My younger brother, he eats this up.

### Revision Ideas
- Add tutorial for new players explaining velocity based damage
- Consider shorter "quick play" mode?
- Hotkeys for abilities
- Better visual feedback for cooldowns
